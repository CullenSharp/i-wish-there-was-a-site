# I Wish There Was a Site

This project is an integration between the Twitter search API and a Next app. My primary goal was to get exposure to the Twitter family of APIs, and to get more experience with Next. Credit is due to [@nicmulvaney](https://twitter.com/nicmulvaney) for inspiring the original idea. His website, which my own is a riff on, can be found at [iwishtherewas.app](https://iwishtherewas.app/). I also give credit to the designer(s) at [Optimist](https://foundation.app/@optimist); their website [pumpmygas.xyz](https://pumpmygas.xyz/) – while it was active – serves as initial inspiration for this project's identity.
